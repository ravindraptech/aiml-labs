End-to-end customer service assistant system using ChatGPT LLM
- chains multiple calls to LLM using input validation, processing different instructions, combining external resources etc.

For example, given a user input like, 
"Tell me about what TVs are for sale?", we'd use the following steps 
to process this. 
First, you can evaluate the input to make sure it doesn't 
contain any problematic content, such as hateful speech. Next, the 
system will process the input. It will identify what type 
of query this is. Is it a complaint or 
a product information request and so on? Once 
it has established that it is a product inquiry, it 
will retrieve the relevant information about 
TVs and use a language model to write a helpful response. 
Finally, you'll check the output to make sure it isn't problematic, 
such as inaccurate or inappropriate answers.
